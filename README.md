# 8BIT-video-game-ecommerce-store
This is my biggest project yet being a fully functional (FICTIONAL) video game ecommerce store that will teach myself HTML, CSS, JAVSCRIPT, PHP and more! Excuse my late start to GitHub. I wrote most of the code before starting this repository. Will start doing periodic commits once certain parts of the website are complete. 
I am fully self taught and have been dabbling in coding for a little over a year but am ready to take my skills to the next level. 
I have 3 goals for this fictional website. 
1.) I want to use php to create an account and log in to the website. 
2.) I want to be able to "purchase" items off the website and view them in my personal cart. 
3.) I want the websites UI and UX to be beautiful and easy to use. 

I hope that building this project will help me become a full time web developer with the understanding that not one website will land me a job. This website is to purely be able to enhance my skills and learn multiple languages furthering develop my arsenal of skills.
